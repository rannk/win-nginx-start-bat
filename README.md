win-nginx-start-bat
===================

Nginx/PHP/MYSQL start bat on windows system

This is a very simple and easy to use script for starting the Nginx/php/mysql service on windows System

You just double click this bat file.

I have tested on windows7 and windows8. I don't know if this script can work on before the windows7 version.

If you want use this script. You need edit this script and replace the Nginx/php/mysql directory with yours
