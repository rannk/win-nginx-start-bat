win-nginx-start-bat
===================
wapp.bat:

Nginx/PHP/MYSQL start bat on windows system

This is a very simple and easy to use script for starting the Nginx/php/mysql service on windows System

You just double click this bat file.

I have tested on windows7 and windows8. I don't know if this script can work on before the windows7 version.

If you want use this script. You need edit this script and replace the Nginx/php/mysql directory with yours

------------------------------------
whosts.bat:

This is very easy script for helping create local web host

For running this script, make sure you already have the ngnix service and PHP envirement.
